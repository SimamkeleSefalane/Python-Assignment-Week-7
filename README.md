# Iris Data Analysis and Visualization

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize the classic Iris dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📂 Files Included

- `iris_analysis.py`: Python script that loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file, performs basic data analysis, and generates visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project and how to run it.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), loaded from the following CSV URL:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv
```

## 🧪 Features of the Script

- Loads and explores the dataset using Pandas
- Displays basic statistics of the numerical features
- Groups the data by species to calculate average values
- Generates 4 visualizations:
  - Line chart of Sepal Length
  - Bar chart of average Petal Length per species
  - Histogram of Sepal Width
  - Scatter plot of Sepal Length vs Petal Length

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python iris_analysis.py
```

## 📌 Notes

- The script uses a direct URL to load the dataset, so an internet connection is required.
- Visualizations will appear in separate pop-up windows.
